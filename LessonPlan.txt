1. Calculator usage, binary operators.

2. Introduce variables for complex calculation storage
  - Hello [Name] example.
  - name = raw_input("Please enter your name:"); print "Hello " + name + "!"

3. Introduce functions for common usage patterns (calculating interest / area / random etc.)
  - Pig Latin name

4. Introduce conditionals

5. Recursive functions (?)
  - Maybe beyond the scope of this introduction

6. Introduce lists and dicts. Emphasize that you can store a list or dict in a variable.

7. Introduce iteraions (for, while etc.)

8. Talk about list functions: Lets not dwell too much on 'Object-Oriented' terms but just emphasize that functions can either be independent or be attached to variables, and if they're attached to variables, they can do special things that relate to the variable.

9. (From here we could talk about writing their own classes, exception-handling and other such topics but I suggest we don't. Lets focus on what python is best at -- get things done quick)

10. Introduce the idea libraries / APIs that will give you simple ways to do the things you want to do; only by using the concepts learned above.
  - graphics
  - web
  - math

11. Delve into a project or two.
