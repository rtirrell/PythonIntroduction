  \begin{quote}
    \textbf{Computer programming} or \textbf{coding} is the process of designing, writing, testing, debugging/troubleshooting, and maintaining the source code of computer programs. 
    This source code is written in a programming language. The purpose of programming is to create a program that exhibits a certain desired behaviour. 
    The process of writing source code often requires expertise in many different subjects, including knowledge of the application domain, specialized algorithms and formal logic.

  \begin{block}{The Heart of the Matter}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item While true, this definition is not particularly helpful, so we propose an alternative.
      \item At its core, programming is just writing a set of instructions which a computer runs on your behalf.
      \item How you conceive of and design those instructions is the fun part (and the challenge).

  \begin{block}{Decomposition}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Decomposition} is the means by which a complex problem or system is broken down into parts that are easier to understand, program and maintain.
      \item This is one of the fundamental principles of design and programming: we decompose the logical structure into smaller, reusable units which we build one-at-a-time.
      \item Sometimes, how this decomposition should proceed isn't immediately clear.
        Then your first step should be thinking in depth about the problem you're facing, and in what ways it can be reduced into component subproblems.

  \begin{block}{Divide and Conquer}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Imagine you are a pin manufacturer in 18th century England.
        To achieve maximum efficiency, you will make pins step-by-step: pounding the metal into a sheet, cutting the sheet into small strips, heating the protopins, elongating the pins, punching an eyelet, polishing the pins, etc..
      \item This is simple enough: just a stepwise series of transformations.
        More often, a computer program will be more complex, and have multiple interdependent parts.

    \item An interpreted, high-level language with flexible typing.
    \item Currently on its third major release... in other words, it's been around the block and has withstood the test of time.

  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{AstraZeneca} uses Python in drug discovery pipelines.
    \item \textbf{Phillips'} fabrication plants are managed in Python.
    \item \textbf{Industrial Light \& Magic} (Star Wars) employs Python for process management.
    \item \textbf{Anshul} developed an AdWords (Google's advertising platform) optimizer in Python.
    \item In \textbf{Rob's} work, people use Python at every point in the research pipeline (preprocessing and sanitization, standard analyses, data aggregation and integration, and so forth).
    \item It may be new to you, but according to TIOBE's programming languages index, Python is the sixth-most popular in the world.
    \item A list of anecdotes can't quite prove a point, so we'll try to justify why you should care about and use Python.

  \frametitle{Good for Them, What's in it for You?}
  \begin{block}{Power}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Python facilitates rapid development.
        It comes with a huge collection of software (libraries) for many purposes.
      \item There is a sizeable, vibrant and very helpful Python community/ecosystem, should you run into trouble or seek advice.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
  \begin{block}{Clarity}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Python is remarkably clear and readable compared to many other languages.
      \item It actually takes some effort to write difficult-to-understand programs.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
%  Before we can reveal Python, let's consider the high-level \textbf{process and principles of programming} (trust us, we know they're abstract and seemingly useless, but it's critical to really get what they mean).
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{The Interpreter (1)}
  \begin{block}{$>>>$}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Python is an interpreted language.
        The computer reads, understands (compiles) and executes it on the fly, instead of reading and compiling ahead of time (as with C, C++, and many others).
      \item Because of this, we can use Python interactively, which is extremely helpful for designing and troubleshooting code.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
  \begin{block}{IDLE}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item IDLE is Python's interpreter shell, which we'll use to walk through examples throughout the course.
      \item For those of you with Macs, you can open a Terminal and launch Python by typing \texttt{python}.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{The Interpreter (2)}
  \begin{block}{The \texttt{print} Function}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Strings are surrounded by single (') or double (``) quotes, which are equivalent (but you must use the same type for any particular string).
        e.g., if you want a string to have a contraction, you can use double quotes to surround it, like \texttt{"The white whale mustn't breach, Moby is waiting."}.
      \item \texttt{print} is a core Python function, which by default outputs text to the screen. It's somewhat special, in that parentheses are optional when using (calling) it.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
  \begin{block}{A Longstanding Tradition}
      Three equivalent \texttt{'Hello, World!'}s:
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PY{k}{print} \PY{l+s}{'}\PY{l+s}{Hello, World!}\PY{l+s}{'}
\PY{k}{print} \PY{l+s}{"}\PY{l+s}{Hello, World!}\PY{l+s}{"}
\PY{k}{print}\PY{p}{(}\PY{l+s}{'}\PY{l+s}{Hello, World!}\PY{l+s}{'}\PY{p}{)}
\end{Verbatim}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{The Interpreter (3)}
  \begin{block}{Not Your Daddy's Desktop Calculator}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Among other uses, we can employ Python as a calculator.
      \item At the interpreter (\texttt{$>>>$}), type \texttt{4 + 2}.
        You should see \texttt{6}.
        So far, so good -- naturally, other operators are available (e.g. \texttt{+ - * /}).
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
  \begin{block}{Balling}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item To delve deeper into Python, we're going to work through a baseball\footnote{Baseball is a popular American sport. Rob's hometown is the supposed 'birthplace of baseball'.} statistics\footnote{The deliberate application of statistics to baseball is known as 'sabremetrics'. Check it out, it's really interesting.} example.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{The Interpreter (4)}
  \begin{block}{Still Balling}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item A player's \textbf{slugging percentage} is calculated as \texttt{(singles + 2 * doubles + 3 * triples + 4 * homers) / at bats}.
        Basically, the numerator is the number of bases that player moves as a result of his offense.
      \item In \texttt{1920}, Babe Ruth appeared at the plate \texttt{458}\footnote{The divisor -- at bats -- needs to be a floating-point number, so enter it as \texttt{458.0}, otherwise Python will drop the fractional component of the result.  This behavior can be a pain, and has been changed in Python 3.} times, cranking out \texttt{73} singles, \texttt{36} doubles, \texttt{9} triples and \texttt{54} home runs.    
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{The Interpreter (5)}
  \begin{block}{More than a Glorified Calculator -- Saving it for Later}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item It can be tedious to have to type out that expression every time.
        Luckily for us and our fingers, we can store the results of calculations in \textbf{variables} very simply in Python.
      \item For example, \texttt{sp = (73 + 2 * 36 + 3 * 9 + 4 * 54) / 458.0}
        If you mess up the numbers, you can always try again.
        The new value will replace the old one.
      \item Voil\`{a}! Try \texttt{print}ing the result.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{The Interpreter (6)}
  \begin{block}{Back to the Babe}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Another useful stat is \texttt{on-base percentage} (OBP), calculated as \texttt{(H + BB + HBP) / (AB + BB + HBP + SF)}.  
        In English, \texttt{(hits + walks + hit by pitches) / (hits + walks + hit by pitches + sacrifice flies)}.
      \item In 1920, the Babe had \texttt{172} hits, walked \texttt{150} times, was hit by \texttt{3} pitches, and had no sacrifice flies (and \texttt{458} at bats).
        What was his OBP (hint: store this in a variable \texttt{obp})?
      \item \textbf{On-base plus slugging} (OPS) is a summary statistic frequently used to quantify players' offensive contributions.
        Since we have both of these measures already stored, calculating Ruth's OPS is as simple as \texttt{sp + obp}!
      \item Hopefully this illustrates the value of saving the results of intermediate computation.
        You'll thank yourself later.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}

  \frametitle{Brief Interlude: Setting Up KomodoEdit}
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=300px]{KomodoEdit.png}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item KomodoEdit should already be installed on the provided computers, if not, visit \href{http://www.activestate.com/komodo-edit/downloads}{http://www.activestate.com/komodo-edit/downloads} to grab it.

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Playing Ball with Datatypes (1)}
  \begin{block}{What are They?}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item A \textbf{datatype} refers to a location in the computer's memory and the type of information stored there.
      \item Numbers can be of the \texttt{int} (integer) datatype, like \texttt{4}, or the \texttt{float} (floating point) datatype, like \texttt{4.0}).
      \item Text uses the \texttt{string} datatype, like \texttt{'Four score and seven years ago...'}.
      \item True and false values are \texttt{bool} (boolean) datatypes, in Python these are \texttt{True} and \texttt{False}.
        There is also a special value called \texttt{None}, that indicates 'no value'.
      \item We can view the type of any variable using \texttt{type}, so typing \texttt{type('bananagram')}  \texttt{return}s \texttt{$<$type 'string'$>$}.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Playing Ball with Datatypes (2)}
  \begin{block}{More Advanced Datatypes}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Obviously, more complex programs require more complex datatypes (also referred to as 'data structures').
      \item The two most important in Python are the \texttt{list} and \texttt{dict} (dictionary).
      \item A list: 
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PY{n}{teams} \PY{o}{=} \PY{p}{[}
  \PY{l+s}{'}\PY{l+s}{Montreal Expos}\PY{l+s}{'}\PY{p}{,} \PY{l+s}{'}\PY{l+s}{Washington Nationals}\PY{l+s}{'}\PY{p}{,}
  \PY{l+s}{'}\PY{l+s}{San Francisco Giants}\PY{l+s}{'}\PY{p}{,} \PY{l+s}{'}\PY{l+s}{New York Yankees}\PY{l+s}{'}
\PY{p}{]}
\end{Verbatim}
      \item A dictionary:

    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Functions} and \textbf{methods}\footnote{There is a difference: methods are attached to and operate on their objects, while functions stand alone. Don't worry too much about this now, we'll come back to it later (and in this course we will only write functions, anyway).} are procedures that work on variables to transform or otherwise alter them.
      \item Many of Python's collection datatypes support element access by index (indexing):
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PY{n}{player}\PY{p}{[}\PY{l+s}{'}\PY{l+s}{name}\PY{l+s}{'}\PY{p}{]} \PY{c}{# 'Babe Ruth'}
\end{Verbatim}
      \item This is an important point: in Python, the first element of a collection is the \texttt{[0]}th'' one, available at \texttt{collection[0]}.
      \item Similarly, for lists:
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PY{n}{teams}\PY{p}{[}\PY{l+m+mi}{0}\PY{p}{]} \PY{c}{# 'Montreal Expos'}

    \item We will code a 'random writer' that reads a document and generates a somewhat sensible-sounding babble based on it.
    \item This will be the whirlwind outro: we'll introduce user input and file input/output.
      The result is pretty cool: \\

        It's gramatically close to English, but semantically meaningless gobbledigook.\footnote{Kind of like Perl :).}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item There are \textbf{tons} of freely-available resources on the internet to continuing experimenting and learning.
    The best place to start is probably Dive Into Python 3 (\href{http://diveintopython3.org}{http://diveintopython3.org}) by Mark Pilgrim.  As the name indicates, it covers Python 3 (we are using 2.7, some things differ but most of what we've gone over is the same).
    \item We haven't even nearly covered the standard library (the stuff that comes with every version of Python). 
      Honestly, I haven't used or even heard of most of it.
    \item Python has builtin modules for scraping from the internet (\texttt{HTMLParser}), (extremely advanced) string searching and manipulation (the strange world of regular expressions, in the \texttt{re} module), creating, deleting and managing files and directories (\texttt{os} and \texttt{shutil}), creating and extracting compressed files (\texttt{gzip}, \texttt{bz2}, \texttt{zipfile}, \texttt{tarfile}), interacting with FTP servers (\texttt{ftplib}), and on and on $\rightarrow \infty$.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{So We've Sold You on Python, What's Next? (2)}
  Stepping away from builtin functionality, there are many other mature libraries in the wild:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item If you want to write websites, check out Google's App Engine (\href{http://code.google.com/appengine/}{http://code.google.com/appengine/}).  It provides free hosting services and holds your hand along the way (that's a good thing!).  For more advanced websites, look into the Django Project (\href{http://www.djangoproject.com/}{http://www.djangoproject.com/}) (App Engine is actually based on Django). 
    \item There are libraries for image manipulation (the Python Imaging Library, \href{http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil}{http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/}), numerical and scientific calculation (NumPy/SciPy, \href{http://numpy.scipy.org/}{http://numpy.scipy.org/}), bioinformatics (BioPython, \href{http://biopython.org/wiki/Biopython}{http://biopython.org/wiki/Biopython}), plus a whole slew of others for most every purpose imaginable.
