    \item That's Self-Appointed Benevolent Dictator for Life (SABDFL) van Rossum to the rest of us.
    \item An interpreted, high-level language with flexible typing.
    \item Currently on its third major release... in other words, it's been around the block and has withstood the test of time.

  \frametitle{Other Satisfied Users}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{AstraZeneca} uses Python in drug discovery pipelines.
    \item \textbf{Phillips'} fabrication plants are managed in Python.
    \item \textbf{Industrial Light \& Magic} (Star Wars) employs Python for process management.
    \item At \textbf{Yahoo}, \textbf{Anshul} developed an AdWords optimizer in Python.
    \item In \textbf{Rob's} work, people use Python at every point in the research pipeline (preprocessing and sanitization, standard analyses, data aggregation and integration, and so forth).
    \item It may be new to you, but according to TIOBE's programming languages index, Python is the sixth-most popular in the world.
    \item A list of anecdotes can't quite prove a point, so we'll try to justify why you should care about and use Python.

  \frametitle{Good for Them, What's in it for You?}
  \begin{block}{Power}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Python facilitates rapid development.
        It comes with a huge collection of software (libraries) for many purposes.
      \item There is a sizeable, vibrant and very helpful Python community/ecosystem, should you run into trouble or seek advice.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
  \begin{block}{Clarity}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Python is remarkably clear and readable compared to many other languages.
      \item It actually takes some effort to write difficult-to-understand programs.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
  Before we can reveal Python, let's consider the high-level \textbf{process and principles of programming} (trust us, we know they're abstract and seemingly useless, but it's critical to really get what they mean).

  \begin{quote}
    \textbf{Computer programming} or \textbf{coding} is the process of designing, writing, testing, debugging/troubleshooting, and maintaining the source code of computer programs. 
    This source code is written in a programming language. The purpose of programming is to create a program that exhibits a certain desired behaviour. 
    The process of writing source code often requires expertise in many different subjects, including knowledge of the application domain, specialized algorithms and formal logic.

  \begin{block}{The Heart of the Matter}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item It's definitions like this that turn people off to programming.
      \item At its core, programming is just writing a set of instructions which a computer runs on your behalf.
      \item How you conceive of and design those instructions is the fun part (and the challenge).
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Principal Principles of Programming (3)}
  \begin{block}{Decomposition}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Decomposition} is the means by which a complex problem or system is broken down into parts that are easier to understand, program and maintain.
      \item This is one of the fundamental principles of design and programming: we decompose the logical structure into smaller, reusable units which we build one-at-a-time.
      \item Sometimes, how this decomposition should proceed isn't immediately clear.
        Then your first step should be thinking in depth about the problem you're facing, and in what ways it can be reduced into component subproblems.

  \frametitle{Principal Principles of Programming (5)}
  \begin{block}{Divide and Conquer}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Imagine you are a pin manufacturer in 18th century England.
        To achieve maximum efficiency, you will make pins step-by-step: pounding the metal into a sheet, cutting the sheet into small strips, heating the protopins, elongating the pins, punching an eyelet, polishing the pins, etc..
      \item This is simple enough: just a stepwise series of transformations.
        More often, a computer program will be more complex, and have multiple interdependent parts.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Principal Principles of Programming (6)}
  \begin{block}{Thinking about a Twitter iPhone App}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Let's motivate this with an example.
      \item Break into groups with your nearest neighbors and discuss how you would design this application.
      \item What are the application and user operations we would want to support, and what are their requirements?
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{The Interpreter (1)}
  \begin{block}{$>>>$}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item As Python is an interpreted language (the computer reads, understands (compiles) and executes it on the fly, instead of reading and compiling ahead of time (as with C, C++, and many others).
      \item Because of this, we can use Python interactively, which is extremely helpful for designing and troubleshooting code.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
  \begin{block}{IDLE}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item IDLE is Python's interpreter shell, which we'll use to walk through examples throughout the course.
      \item For those of you with Macs, you can open a Terminal and launch Python by typing \texttt{python}.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{The Interpreter (2)}
  \begin{block}{The \texttt{print} Function}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Strings are surrounded by single (') or double (``) quotes, which are equivalent (but you must use the same type for any particular string).
        e.g., if you want a string to have a contraction \texttt{"mustn't"}, you can use double quotes to surround it, like \texttt{"The white whale mustn't breach, Moby is waiting."}.
      \item \texttt{print} is a core Python function, which by default outputs text to the screen. It's somewhat special, in that parentheses are optional when using (calling) it.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
  \begin{block}{A Longstanding Tradition}
      Three equivalent \texttt{'Hello, World!'}s:
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PY{k}{print} \PY{l+s}{'}\PY{l+s}{Hello, World!}\PY{l+s}{'}
\PY{k}{print} \PY{l+s}{"}\PY{l+s}{Hello, World!}\PY{l+s}{"}
\PY{k}{print}\PY{p}{(}\PY{l+s}{'}\PY{l+s}{Hello, World!}\PY{l+s}{'}\PY{p}{)}
\end{Verbatim}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{The Interpreter (3)}
  \begin{block}{Not Your Daddy's Desktop Calculator}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Among other uses, we can employ Python as a calculator.
      \item At the interpreter (\texttt{$>>>$}), type \texttt{4 + 2}.
        You should see \texttt{6}.
        So far, so good -- naturally, other operators are available (e.g. \texttt{+ - * /}).
      \item A player's \textbf{slugging percentage} (in baseball) is calculated as \texttt{(singles + 2 * doubles + 3 * triples + 4 * homers) / at bats}.
      \item In \texttt{1920}, Babe Ruth appeared at the plate \texttt{458} times, cranking out \texttt{73} singles, \texttt{36} doubles, \texttt{9} triples and \texttt{54} home runs.
        What was his slugging percentage?\footnote{The divisor needs to be a floating-point number (\texttt{458.0}), otherwise Python will drop the fractional component of a number.  This behavior can be a pain, and has been changed in Python 3.}
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{The Interpreter (4)}
  \begin{block}{More than a Glorified Calculator -- Saving it for Later}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item It can be tedious to have to type out that expression every time.
        Luckily for us and our fingers, we can store the results of calculations in \textbf{variables} very simply in Python.
      \item For example, \texttt{sp = (73 + 2 * 36 + 3 * 9 + 4 * 54) / 458.0}
        If you mess up the numbers, you can always try again.
        The new value will replace the old one.
      \item Voil\`{a}! Try \texttt{print}ing the result.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{The Interpreter (5)}
  \begin{block}{Back to the Babe}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Another useful stat is \texttt{on-base percentage} (OBP), calculated as \texttt{(H + BB + HBP) / (AB + BB + HBP + SF)}.  
        In English, \texttt{(hits + walks + hit by pitches) / (hits + walks + hit by pitches + sacrifice flies)}.
      \item In 1920, the Babe had \texttt{172} hits, walked \texttt{150} times, was hit by \texttt{3} pitches, and had no sacrifice flies (and \texttt{458} at bats).
        What was his OBP (hint: store this in a variable \texttt{obp})?
      \item Finally, to close out the baseball, \textbf{on-base plus slugging} (OPS) is a concise statistic frequently used to quantify players' offensive contributions.
        Since we have both of these measures already stored, calculating Ruth's OPS is as simple as \texttt{sp + obp}!
      \item Hopefully this illustrates the value of saving the results of intermediate computation.
        You'll thank yourself later.
    \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Datatypes (1)}
  \begin{block}{What are They?}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item A \textbf{datatype} refers to a location in the computer's memory and the type of information stored there.
      \item Numbers can be of the \texttt{int} (integer) datatype, like \texttt{4}, or the \texttt{float} (floating point) datatype, like \texttt{4.0}).
      \item Text uses the \texttt{string} datatype, like \texttt{'Four score and seven years ago...'}.
      \item True and false values are \texttt{bool} (boolean) datatypes, in Python these are \texttt{True} and \texttt{False}.
        There is also a special value called \texttt{None}, that indicates 'no value'.
      \item We can view the type of any variable using \texttt{type}, so typing \texttt{type('bananagram')}  \texttt{return}s \texttt{$<$type 'string'$>$}.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Datatypes (2)}
  \begin{block}{More Advanced Datatypes}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Obviously, more complex programs require more complex datatypes (depending on the complexity, they may be referred to as 'data structures').
      \item The two most important in Python are the \texttt{list} and \texttt{dict} (dictionary).
      \item A list: 
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PY{n}{some\PYZus{}list} \PY{o}{=} \PY{p}{[}\PY{l+m+mi}{12}\PY{p}{,} \PY{l+s}{'}\PY{l+s}{monkeys}\PY{l+s}{'}\PY{p}{]}
\end{Verbatim}
      \item A dictionary:
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PY{n}{some\PYZus{}dict} \PY{o}{=} \PY{p}{\PYZob{}}
  \PY{l+s}{'}\PY{l+s}{New York}\PY{l+s}{'}\PY{p}{:} \PY{l+s}{'}\PY{l+s}{A state in the US.}\PY{l+s}{'}\PY{p}{,}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Datatypes (3)}
  \begin{block}{Duck Typing}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item The Python philosophy: if it looks like a duck, and it quacks like a duck, then it's a duck.
      \item In other words, variables are not restricted to contain a particular datatype.
        We can re-assign them to anything we want:
        \footnotesize
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PY{n}{var} \PY{o}{=} \PY{l+m+mi}{44}
\PY{n}{var} \PY{o}{=} \PY{l+s}{'}\PY{l+s}{The Life of Brian}\PY{l+s}{'}

Don't worry too much about this now, we'll come back to it later (and in this course will only write functions, anyway).} are procedures that work on variables to transform or otherwise alter them.

  \begin{block}{Improving Pig Latinization}
    You probably noticed that capitalized characters look out of place in the first version of the function.
    There are two string methods, \texttt{lower} and \texttt{capitalize}\footnote{An exhaustive list of string methods is available at \href{http://docs.python.org/library/string.html}{http://docs.python.org/library/string.html}.  All of the builtin libraries are well-documented, see \href{http://docs.python.org}{http://docs.python.org}}, that we can use to fix this problem.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Modify the function so that it converts the pig latinized string to lowercase, then capitalizes it.
      \item We can do all of this in one line, but it is easier to read and understand if you store the intermediate pig latinized string in its own variables, like \texttt{pig\_latinized\_string}.
      \item Helpfully, we can 'chain' method calls, in other words, \texttt{some\_string.lower().capitalize()} works!

  Stepping away from builtin functionality, there are many other mature libraries in the wild:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item If you want to write websites, check out Google's App Engine (\href{http://code.google.com/appengine/}{http://code.google.com/appengine/}).  It provides free hosting services and holds your hand along the way (that's a good thing!).  For more advanced websites, look into the Django Project (\href{http://www.djangoproject.com/}{http://www.djangoproject.com/}) (App Engine is actually based on Django). 
    \item There are libraries for image manipulation (the Python Imaging Library, \href{http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil}{http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/}), numerical and scientific calculation (NumPy/SciPy, \href{http://numpy.scipy.org/}{http://numpy.scipy.org/}), bioinformatics (BioPython, \href{http://biopython.org/wiki/Biopython}{http://biopython.org/wiki/Biopython}), plus a whole slew of others for most every purpose imaginable.
