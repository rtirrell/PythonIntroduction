Introduction/Teaching 
  - Fibonacci.
  - String Formatting.

Project (if we organize like this)
  - Command-line Google fight (DONE).
  - Simple websites (DONE).
  - Image manipulation (with PIL).  But installation might be a bit too involved/time-consuming.
  - PDF generation (with ReportLab)
  - "Find duplicated words in your essay", suggest alternatives.  We'd provide an implementation of the Porter stemmer, they'd code the find duplicates and request synonyms from web service parts.  A slightly-modified implementation of Porter is in py/, stemming and counting code DONE, synonym fetching TODO (maybe?).
