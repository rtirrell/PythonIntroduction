  - Fibonacci

Project (if we organize like this)
  - Command-line Google fight
  - Twitter client
  - Simple websites
  - Image manipulation (with PIL)
  - PDF generation (with ReportLab)
  - "Find duplicated words in your essay", suggest alternatives (we'd provide an implementation of the Porter stemmer, they'd code the find duplicates and request synonyms from web service parts).
