  \begin{quote}
    \textbf{Computer programming} or \textbf{coding} is the process of designing, writing, testing, debugging/troubleshooting, and maintaining the source code of computer programs. 
    This source code is written in a programming language. The purpose of programming is to create a program that exhibits a certain desired behaviour. 
    The process of writing source code often requires expertise in many different subjects, including knowledge of the application domain, specialized algorithms and formal logic.

  \begin{block}{Decomposition}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Decomposition} is the means by which a complex problem or system is broken down into parts that are easier to understand, program and maintain.
      \item This is one of the fundamental principles of design and programming: we decompose the logical structure into smaller, reusable units which we build one-at-a-time.
      \item Sometimes, how this decomposition should proceed isn't immediately clear.
        Then your first step should be thinking in depth about the problem you're facing, and in what ways it can be reduced into component subproblems.

  \begin{block}{Divide and Conquer}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Imagine you are a pin manufacturer in 18th century England.
        To achieve maximum efficiency, you will make pins step-by-step: pounding the metal into a sheet, cutting the sheet into small strips, heating the protopins, elongating the pins, punching an eyelet, polishing the pins, etc..
      \item This is simple enough: just a stepwise series of transformations.
        More often, a computer program will be more complex, and have multiple interdependent parts.

  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{AstraZeneca} uses Python in drug discovery pipelines.
    \item \textbf{Phillips'} fabrication plants are managed in Python.
    \item \textbf{Industrial Light \& Magic} (Star Wars) employs Python for process management.
    \item \textbf{Anshul} developed an AdWords (Google's advertising platform) optimizer in Python.
    \item In \textbf{Rob's} work, people use Python at every point in the research pipeline (preprocessing and sanitization, standard analyses, data aggregation and integration, and so forth).
    \item It may be new to you, but according to TIOBE's programming languages index, Python is the sixth-most popular in the world.
    \item A list of anecdotes can't quite prove a point, so we'll try to justify why you should care about and use Python.

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Good for Them, What's in it for You?}
  \begin{block}{Power}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Python facilitates rapid development (quickly going from idea to implementation).
        It comes with a huge collection of software (libraries) for many purposes, and external libraries exist for many others.
      \item There is a sizeable, vibrant and very helpful Python community/ecosystem, should you run into trouble or seek advice.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
  \begin{block}{Clarity}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Python is remarkably clear and readable compared to many other languages.
      \item It actually takes some effort to write difficult-to-understand programs.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{The Interpreter (1)}
  \begin{block}{$>>>$}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Python is an interpreted language.
        The computer reads, understands (compiles) and executes it on the fly, instead of reading and compiling ahead of time (as with C, C++, and many others).
      \item Because of this, we can use Python interactively, which is extremely helpful for designing and troubleshooting code.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
  \begin{block}{IDLE}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item IDLE is Python's official graphical interpreter, which we'll use to walk through examples throughout the course.
      \item For those of you with Macs, you can open a Terminal and launch a console interpreter by typing \texttt{python}.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{The Interpreter (2)}
  \begin{block}{The \texttt{print} Function}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \texttt{string}s are surrounded by single (') or double (``) quotes, which are equivalent (but you must use the same type for any particular \texttt{string}).
        e.g., if you want a \texttt{string} to have a contraction, you can use double quotes to surround it, like \texttt{"The white whale mustn't breach, Moby is waiting."}.
      \item \texttt{print} is a core Python function, which by default outputs text to the screen. It's somewhat special, in that parentheses are optional when using (calling) it.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
  \begin{block}{A Longstanding Tradition}
    Three equivalent \texttt{'Hello, World!'}s:
    \begin{pythoncode}
  print 'Hello, World!'
  print "Hello, World!"
  print("Hello, World!")
    \end{pythoncode}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{The Interpreter (3)}
  \begin{block}{Not Your Daddy's Desktop Calculator}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Among other uses, we can employ Python as a calculator.
      \item At the interpreter (\texttt{$>>>$}), type \texttt{4 + 2}.
        You should see \texttt{6}.
        So far, so good -- naturally, other operators are available (e.g. \texttt{+ - * /}).
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
  \begin{block}{Balling}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item To delve deeper into Python, we're going to work through a baseball\footnote{Baseball is a popular American sport. Rob's hometown is the supposed 'birthplace of baseball'.} statistics\footnote{The deliberate application of statistics to baseball is known as 'sabremetrics'. Check it out, it's really interesting.} example.

  \frametitle{The Interpreter (4)}
  \begin{block}{Still Balling}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item The number of bases a player moves as a result of his offense is calculated as:  
      \mint{python}|singles + 2 * doubles + 3 * triples + 4 * homers|
      \item In \texttt{1920}, Babe Ruth appeared at the plate \texttt{458} times, cranking out \texttt{73} singles, \texttt{36} doubles, \texttt{9} triples and \texttt{54} home runs.    
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{The Interpreter (5)}
  \begin{block}{More than a Glorified Calculator -- Saving it for Later}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item It can be tedious to have to type out that expression every time.
        Luckily for us and our fingers, we can store the results of calculations in \textbf{variables} very simply in Python.
      \item For example, \mint{python}|bases = 73 + 2 * 36 + 3 * 9 + 4 * 54|
        If you mess up the numbers, you can always try again.
        The new value will replace the old one.
      \item Voil\`{a}! Try \texttt{print}ing the result.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{The Interpreter (6)}
  \begin{block}{Back to the Babe}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Another useful statistic is \textbf{slugging percentage} (SP):    
      \footnotesize
      \begin{pythoncode}
  (singles + 2 * doubles + 3 * triples + 4 * homers) / at_bats
      \end{pythoncode}
      \normalsize
      \item Since we've already calculated the numerator --- the number of bases the player moves as a result of his offense --- it's trivial to calculate the slugging percentage.
      \footnote{The divisor -- at bats -- needs to be a floating-point number, so enter it as \texttt{458.0}, otherwise Python will drop the fractional component of the result.  This behavior can be a pain, and has been changed in Python 3.}
      \begin{pythoncode}
  bases = 73 + 2 * 36 + 3 * 9 + 4 * 54
  sp = bases / 458.0
  print sp
      \end{pythoncode}

  \frametitle{Playing Ball with Datatypes (1)}
  \begin{block}{What are They?}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item A \textbf{datatype} refers to a location in the computer's memory and the type of information stored there.
      \item Numbers can be of the \texttt{int} (integer) datatype, like \texttt{4}, or the \texttt{float} (floating point) datatype, like \texttt{4.0}).
      \item Text uses the \texttt{string} datatype, like \texttt{'Four score and seven years ago...'}.
      \item True and false values are \texttt{bool} (boolean) datatypes, in Python these are \texttt{True} and \texttt{False}.
        There is also a special value called \texttt{None}, that indicates 'no value'.
      \item We can view the type of any variable using \texttt{type}, so typing \texttt{type('bananagram')}  \texttt{return}s \texttt{$<$type 'string'$>$}.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Playing Ball with Datatypes (2)}
  \begin{block}{More Advanced Datatypes}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Obviously, more complex programs require more complex datatypes (also referred to as 'data structures').
      \item The most important in Python are \texttt{list}s and \texttt{dict}s (dictionaries).
        \begin{pythoncode}
  teams = [
    'Montreal Expos', 'Washington Nationals',
    'San Francisco Giants', 'New York Yankeees'
  ]
  player = {
    'name': 'Babe Ruth', 'ab': 458, 'h': 172,
    '1b': 73, '2b': 36, '3b': 9, 'hr': 54,
    'bb': 150, 'hbp': 3, 'sf': 0
  }
        \end{pythoncode}
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Functions for Fame and Fortune (and Baseball) (1)}
  \begin{block}{Python Provides Many Functions for Free}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Functions} and \textbf{methods}\footnote{There is a difference: methods are attached to and operate on their objects, while functions stand alone. Don't worry too much about this now, we'll come back to it later (and in this course we will only write functions, anyway).} are procedures that work on variables to transform or otherwise alter them.
      \item Many of Python's collection datatypes support element access by index (indexing):
        \mint{python}|player['name'] # 'Babe Ruth'|

      \item This is an important point: in Python, the first element of a collection is the \texttt{[0]}th'' one, available at \texttt{collection[0]}.
      \item Similarly, for lists:
        \mint{python}|teams[0] # 'Montreal Expos'|
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Functions for Fame and Fortune (and Baseball) (2)}
  \begin{block}{A Few More Examples}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Change a \texttt{string} to all uppercase:
        \mint{python}|teams[0].upper() # 'MONTREAL EXPOS'|
      \item Add an entry to a \texttt{list}:
        \mint{python}|teams.append('Krypton Krushers')|
      \item Compute the \texttt{sum} of a \texttt{list} using the builtin \texttt{sum} function:
        \mint{python}|sum(player['h'], player['bb']) # 322|
      \item \texttt{return} the \texttt{len}gth of a collection:
        \mint{python}|len(teams) # 4, or 5 counting the Krushers.|
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Functions for Fame and Fortune (and Baseball) (3)}
  \begin{block}{Writing Your Own with \texttt{def}}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item The \texttt{def} keyword is used to create new functions.
      \item Functions always \texttt{return} a value. 
        Functions not explicitly \texttt{return}ing a value (have no \texttt{return} statement) implicitly \texttt{return None}.
        \begin{pythoncode}
  # This function has no parameters and returns None.
  def test_func():
    print "I'm useless!"
        \end{pythoncode}
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Functions for Fame and Fortune (and Baseball) (4)}
  \begin{block}{Funcball}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item If we represent a player as in the \texttt{dict}ionary above, we can then write functions that calculates any player's stats.\footnote{The \texttt{'\textbackslash'} just allows us to continue an expression on the next line, so it doesn't run off of the slide :).}
      \footnotesize
      \begin{pythoncode}
  def calculate_bases(player)
    return player['h'] + 2 * player['2b'] + \
      3 * player['3b'] + 4 * player['hr']
  def calculate_sp(player):
    return calculate_bases(player) / float(player['ab'])
      \end{pythoncode}
      \normalsize
      \item Functions exist to coerce \texttt{string}s like \texttt{'1024'} into the corresponding floating-point or integer numbers (c.f. the \texttt{int} and \texttt{float} functions), or numbers into the corresponding \texttt{string} (c.f. the \texttt{str} function).
      \item We use the \texttt{float} functions here to account for Python's division behavior, as explained earlier.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Loops (1)}
  \begin{block}{Loopball}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Suppose we have all of the players in baseball stored in a \texttt{list} (the elements of the \texttt{list} are \texttt{dict}ionaries representing players).
      \item We could calculate their stats one-by-one, but that is just wrong.
        Instead, we have the \texttt{for}-loop construct:
        \begin{pythoncode}
  for player in players:
    sp = calculate_sp(player)
    print player['name']
    print 'Slugging percentage: ' + str(sp)
        \end{pythoncode}
      \item Then the basic syntax is:
      \begin{pythoncode}
  for item in collection_of_items:
    do()
    stuff = 2 + some + items
      \end{pythoncode}
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Loops (2)}
  \begin{block}{Whileball}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Another type of loop is available to us: the \texttt{while} loop:
        \begin{pythoncode}
  prompt = 'Enter your batting average: '
  batting_average = 0
  while batting_average <= 0.350:
    # Convert the string from the user into a float.
    batting_average = float(raw_input(prompt))
  print 'Your average is >= 0.350.'
  print 'But you already knew that...'
        \end{pythoncode}
      \item Then the basic syntax is:
        \begin{pythoncode}
  while some_condition_is_true:
    perform()
    any_number = of_operations
        \end{pythoncode}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Loops (3)}
  \begin{block}{ABA: Average Batting Average}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item How about a more useful example:
        \begin{pythoncode}
  print 'Give me some averages!'
  print "Enter a negative number when you're done."

  prompt = 'Enter a batting average: '
  batting_average = 1
  batting_averages = []

  while batting_average > 0:
    # Convert the string from the user into a float.
    batting_average = float(raw_input(prompt))
    batting_averages.append(batting_average)

  print sum(batting_averages) / len(batting_averages)
        \end{pythoncode}
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}




\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Rolling Your Own Classes}
  \begin{block}{Custom-Created Classes}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item We can also write custom \texttt{class}es with the \texttt{class} keyword, with which we can define datatypes (or data structures) that store arbitrary data and have a set of methods to manipulate it.\footnote{\textbf{Functions} versus \textbf{methods}: \texttt{say\_hello} is an example of a \texttt{method}, it's associated with \texttt{MyTestClass} objects.}
        \footnotesize
        \begin{pythoncode}
  class MyTestClass:
    def __init__(self, name):
      self.name = name
    def say_hello(self, other_name):
      print self.name + ' says hi to ' + other_name
  my_test_class_instance = MyTestClass('Rocko')
  my_test_class_instance.say_hello('Clarissa')
  # 'Rocko says hi to Clarissa'
        \end{pythoncode}
      \normalsize
      \item The ability to extend the language with our own \texttt{class}es is extremely useful, but for concerns of time we'll just dangle the idea in front of you and leave it that.
        Any book on Python will have a more thorough treatment of \texttt{class}es.

  \begin{block}{Truth Testing}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Few programs are just a straight pipeline of unbiased transformations to data -- most of the time, we'll want to branch out and make decisions based on input.
      \item Python has \texttt{if}, \texttt{elif} and \texttt{else} keywords that provide this ability.
      \begin{pythoncode}
  some_boolean = True
  if some_boolean:
    print 'Truly today is a special day!'
  else:
    print 'Back to the grind, peasant.'

  \begin{block}{Odd or Even?}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item The modulus operator \texttt{\%} gives you the remainder of a division of two \texttt{int}egers.
        \begin{pythoncode}
  10 % 3 # The remainder when dividing 10 by 3 is 1.
  4 % 2 # The remainder when dividing 4 by 2 is 0.
        \end{pythoncode}

      \item You can get the user to enter an input number as follows:
        \begin{pythoncode}
  user_number = int(raw_input('Enter a number: '))
        \end{pythoncode}
        Write a program that asks the user to input a number, then \texttt{print}s out if the number is odd or even.

        \mint{python}|703 * weight / h ** 2|

      \item Hint 1: remember the average of batting averages?
        It'll look a lot like that.
      \item Hint 2: use \texttt{append} and \texttt{while}!
      \item Hint 3: use two builtin functions we've seen to easily compute the average, as we did with batting averages:
        \footnotesize
        \begin{pythoncode}
  def average(list_of_numbers):
    # Make sure that the length is calculated as a float to
    # prevent Python from performing truncating integer division.

  \begin{block}{A Profitable Business Proposition}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item You run a candy shoppe, selling all variety of popsticks, licorice screamers, fireballs and the like.
      \item Little kids are big business you, and these little sugar fiends are spending their parents money and are not very sensitive to changes in price.
        Being a businessperson first and foremost concerned with the bottom line, you want to charge anyone less than \texttt{14} years old a little bit extra (\texttt{25\%} over regular price).
      \item But you're not a monster, and if the customer's blood sugar is below \texttt{2.5}, you'll give him or her a \texttt{15\%} discount (with no additional penalty for being less than \texttt{14}).
      \item You want this to be done transparently, so you will add a function to your cash machine that jacks up the price depending on the customer's information (which is stored in the customer's loyalty card).
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Case Study: The Candy Shoppe (2)}
  \begin{block}{Customer Information}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Each customer's loyalty card has several attributes encoded in the magstripe.
      \item These attributes are loaded into the cash machine when you scan the card, and are available to the software as a \texttt{dict}ionary.
        \begin{pythoncode}
  customer_info = {
    'name': 'GI Jane',
    'email': 'jane@army.mil',
    'age': 38,
    'blood_sugar': 5.0 # mmol / L
    'likes_dark_chocolate': True,
    'astrological_sign': 'Gemini'

  \frametitle{Case Study: The Candy Shoppe (3)}
  \begin{block}{Implementation}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Recall that we access dictionary values by their key, so for the above example, \texttt{customer\_info['age']} will \texttt{return 38}.
      \item We can make comparisons with \texttt{dict}ionary values directly, without storing the value in a separate variable:
        \begin{pythoncode}
  if customer_info['age'] > 65:
    print 'Senior citizen discount!'
        \end{pythoncode}
      \item We want to write a function, that given the purchase price and a customer's information, 'adjusts' the price appropriately.
        It should \texttt{return} a number and look something like:
        \begin{pythoncode}
  def compute_price(base_price, customer_info):
    pass # Fill in here!

  \frametitle{Importing and Using Modules (1)}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item So far, we've only played with the core of Python, so let's dive into the standard library (the suite of useful software that comes with Python).
    \item To load any one of these libraries, we use \texttt{import} statements:
      \begin{pythoncode}
  import random
  # Generate an integer from 1 to 6 (inclusive).
  random.randint(1, 6)
  # Generate an integer from 1 to *5* (exclusive).
  random.rangrange(1, 6)

  \begin{block}{Who's Feeling Lucky?!}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Let's use \texttt{random} to pick the winner of a lottery.
        First, define the players:
        \begin{pythoncode}
  lottery_players = [
    'Rufus', 'Sun', 'Tania',
    'Boris', 'Rocky', 'Daisy'
  ]
        \end{pythoncode}
      \item Then, picking a winner with \texttt{random} is stupid simple:
        \mint{python}|print random.choice(lottery_players)|
    \end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Importing and Using Modules (3)}
  \begin{block}{Another Way}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item We can also pick a random player by index in the \texttt{list}:
      \mint{python}|random.randrange(0, len(lottery_players))|
      There are a few things to note here.
      \item The \texttt{len}gth of the \texttt{list} is one greater than the last position you can index to.
      The last is then:
        \mint{python}|lottery_players[len(lottery_players) - 1]|
      \item Since \texttt{randrange} generates a number exclusive of its second argument, we can just use the \texttt{len}gth as the second argument.\footnote{Actually, we can also omit \texttt{0}, \texttt{randrange} or \texttt{randint} with one argument are assumed to start at \texttt{0}.}

    Download the \texttt{smalltweetlib.py} file from 
      \footnotesize \href{https://github.com/rtirrell/PythonIntroduction/raw/master/Source/twitter/smalltweetlib.py}{https://github.com/rtirrell/PythonIntroduction/raw/master/Source/twitter/smalltweetlib.py}.

    \item Create a \texttt{.py} file in the directory you save \texttt{smalltweetlib.py} to, and import \texttt{get\_tweets} at the top: 
      \mint{python}|from smalltweetlib import get_tweets|
      This provides a function \texttt{get\_tweets} which \texttt{return}s a list of \texttt{dict}ionary objects with text and date attributes.
    \item To get started, try this simple command: 
      \mint{python}|print get_tweets('cnn')|
      You can also run it directly (i.e., \texttt{python smalltweetlib.py}).
      It will output tweets from CNN and the NY Times, ordered by date.

    \item Examine the output from \texttt{get\_tweets} -- it's a \texttt{list}, so you'll want to give a single tweet as the argument to your formatting and \texttt{print}ing function.

    There are \textbf{tons} of freely-available resources on the internet to continuing experimenting and learning. 
      Two books that provide particularly good starting points:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Anshul endorses \emph{A Byte of Python} (\href{http://swaroopch.com/notes/Python}{http://swaroopch.com/notes/Python}).
    \item Rob endorses \emph{Dive Into Python 3}, a slightly more advanced introduction (\href{http://diveintopython3.org}{http://diveintopython3.org}).  As the name indicates, it covers Python 3 (we are using 2.7, some things differ but most of what we've gone over is the same).
    There's also a \emph{Dive into Python}   covering 2.4, but that's getting a bit dated.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{So We've Sold You on Python, What's Next? (2)}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item We haven't even nearly covered the standard library (the stuff that comes with every version of Python). 
      Honestly, I haven't used or even heard of most of it.
    \item Python has builtin modules for:
    \begin{itemize} 
      \item Scraping from the internet (\texttt{HTMLParser}).
      \item (Extremely advanced) \texttt{string} searching and manipulation (the strange world of regular expressions, in the \texttt{re} module).
      \item Creating, deleting and managing files and directories (\texttt{os} and \texttt{shutil}).
      \item Creating and extracting compressed files (\texttt{gzip}, \texttt{bz2}, \texttt{zipfile}, \texttt{tarfile}).
      \item Interacting with FTP servers (\texttt{ftplib}).
      \item And so on and on $\rightarrow \infty$.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{So We've Sold You on Python, What's Next? (3)}
  Stepping away from builtin functionality, there are many other mature libraries in the wild:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item If you want to write websites, check out Google's App Engine (\href{http://code.google.com/appengine/}{http://code.google.com/appengine/}).  It provides free hosting services and holds your hand along the way (that's a good thing!).  For more advanced websites, look into the Django Project (\href{http://www.djangoproject.com/}{http://www.djangoproject.com/}) (App Engine is actually based on Django). 
    \item There are libraries for image manipulation (the Python Imaging Library, \href{http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil}{http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/}), numerical and scientific calculation (NumPy/SciPy, \href{http://numpy.scipy.org/}{http://numpy.scipy.org/}), bioinformatics (BioPython, \href{http://biopython.org/wiki/Biopython}{http://biopython.org/wiki/Biopython}), plus a whole slew of others for most every purpose imaginable.
